# Justified alignment
A type of [[Typographic alignment]]. Justified text aligns the start and end of each consecutive line, often through the use of [[Microtypography]]. This gives the appearance of a neat, solid column of text.

Contrast this to [[Ragged text]], where the ends of the line do not necessarily align, so that a paragraph does not appear to be rectangular.
