# Writing is a quick source of internal feedback
When you write you are constantly receiving feedback from yourself in a way that you can easily skip over when thinking in your head. This feedback leads to greater understanding, which is a source of motivation for your [[Self-sustaining motivational cycle]]. 

The speed is important. Without it your feedback may be so delayed that your cycle loses momentum. It is simply demotivating to not see progress in your understanding.
