# Self-sustaining motivational cycle
A self-sustaining motivational cycle is one that generates enough energy from the activity itself that you don't need an external source of motivation to keep you going.

Internal motivation can be generated by seeing results and getting feedback. [[202112261348 Feedback from other people leads to growth]], but so does feedback from inside of yourself. [[202112261351 Writing is a quick source of internal feedback]], which is part of why viewing [[202112261046 Writing is thinking|writing as thinking]] is so important.

When you don't have a self-sustaining motivational cycle, you risk [[202112261610 Burnout]] not only because you might run out of steam, but because [[202112261559 Negative associations to effort lead to burnout]]. Instead of more internal motivation coming out of your work, you get *less*, arresting the cycle.
