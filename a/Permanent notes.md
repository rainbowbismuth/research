# Permanent notes
Notes that are meant to last. They fulfil multiple functions not just during review, but most importantly during *writing*.

[[Permanent notes are your own thoughts and words]], but you should [[Write permanent notes as if for someone else]]. When these two aspects are combined you are forced to integrate the material into your own conceptual framework while checking that the understanding is deep enough to teach it.

[[Better thinking is what is important about note taking]], not the collection of notes themselves, and [[Writing is thinking]]. But that doesn't mean the resulting note doesn't matter. [[Permanent notes leave room for open questions]] to come back to, and [[Permanent notes are densely linked to form new connections|202112261105 are densely linked to form new connections]], and these both serve the goal of better thinking and generating new insights.

[[Permanent notes are general purpose]], not project specific, to make the best use of your time.
