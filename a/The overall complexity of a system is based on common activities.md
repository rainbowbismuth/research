# The overall complexity of a system is based on common activities
While there's no true global judge of [[System Complexity]], because [[The complexity of a system is relative to a specific goal and time]] you could base a measure of complexity with reference to a set of people and the most common activities in the system. Activities here meaning acts of understanding or changing the system.

In a loose mathematical way you could say that:

$$ C = \sum_{p}{c_p t_p} $$
Where $C$ is the overall complexity, $p$ is a particular point in time, $c_p$ is the complexity of that task, and $t_p$ is the fraction of time spent doing that task.
