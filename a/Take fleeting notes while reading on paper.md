# Take fleeting notes while reading on paper
This is personal preference of course, but I find it much easier to read while not in front of a computer. Even while reading a book on a computer screen I think it's easier to have it be the only thing on the screen, and not otherwise engaged with the keyboard.

Once I'm done reading for the moment, I type up a slightly more elaborated set of the physical [[Fleeting notes]] electronically in a single file. This helps me make sure I remember the concepts and keywords I wrote down while reading, and I engage in enough thinking to reorganize towards how the fleeting notes will be turned into, or added to, [[Permanent notes]]. This makes the new digital fleeting note a bit of a writing todo list.

You should handle and [[Discard fleeting notes promptly]] before context is lost.
