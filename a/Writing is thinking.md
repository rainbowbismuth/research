# Writing is thinking
Writing is thinking means that you can't fully understand an idea unless you are engaging with it. It doesn't necessarily require prose, but could involve writing code, or discussing deeply, or drawing. All of these involve feedback, from yourself or another person, in an immediate way.

When you don't write about an idea it is inherently fuzzier and depends more on the current context of your mind, and that can be easily forgotten. Sometime as quickly as it takes to move to another room or to read a notification your phone.
