# Burnout
Burnout is a state where you cannot bring yourself to put forth effort on one or more projects or areas of your life. [[Negative associations to effort lead to burnout]], and a [[Self-sustaining motivational cycle]] can help prevent it.

[[Rest is crucial]], and emphasizing that can help you exit burnout, but more importantly you need to work on reversing the negative associations to your effort that lead to burnout in the first place.
