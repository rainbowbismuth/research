# Verbatim copying changes meaning
When you copy a quote from a text exactly into a [[Permanent notes|permanent note]] you change the meaning. This is because the meaning of the text is partially supplied by its context, and you removed it and put a foreign context around the quote.

Instead it is better to rephrase it into your own words, so that the meaning translates into the context of your notes.
