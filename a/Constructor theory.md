# Constructor theory

A newer theory of physics that is concerned less with [[Dynamical laws|dynamical laws]] but sets of possible and impossible transformations, called *constructors* and their combinations. By elevating counterfactuals into the theory itself, you can find out what is possible or impossible without understanding the dynamics of the system under consideration.
