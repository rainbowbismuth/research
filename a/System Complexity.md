# System Complexity
A measure of how resistant a system is to understanding, modification, and use.

[[Complexity is anything that makes it hard to understand and change a system]], and [[The complexity of a system is relative to a specific goal and time]]. [[There is no global measure of complexity]], but [[The overall complexity of a system is based on common activities]].

System complexity has three main symptoms:

* [[Change amplification is a source of complexity]], which is when a small change requires many additional changes.
* [[Cognitive load is a source of complexity]], which is how difficult it is to understand and keep the system in your head to use or modify it.
* [[Unknown unknowns are a source of complexity]], which is when you can't even tell what a modification might require you to do or if it is possible. You don't know what you don't know. This is the worst symptom out of the three.
