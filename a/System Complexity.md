# System Complexity
A measure of how resistant a system is to understanding, modification, and use.

[[Complexity is anything that makes it hard to understand and change a system]], and [[The complexity of a system is relative to a specific goal and time]]. [[There is no global measure of complexity]], but [[The overall complexity of a system is based on common activities]]. [[Complexity is incremental]] and doesn't appear all at once.

System complexity has three main symptoms:

* [[Change Amplification]], which is when a small change requires many additional changes.
* [[Cognitive Load]], which is how difficult it is to understand and keep the system in your head to use or modify it.
* [[Unknown unknowns]], which is when you can't even tell what a modification might require you to do or if it is possible. You don't know what you don't know. [[Unknown unknowns are the worst symptom of complexity]].

System complexity also has two main causes:

* [[Dependencies cause system complexity]], because they expand the scope of things you need to understand and potentially modify about system.
* [[Obscurity causes system complexity]], because when important information is not obvious it causes the worst symptom of complexity, [[Unknown unknowns]].
