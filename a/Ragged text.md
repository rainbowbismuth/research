# Ragged text
In [[Typography]], ragged text is a column of text where the ends of consecutive lines do not align. This leads to a bumpy or non-rectangular appearance.

Contrast this with [[Justified alignment]], where the start and end of each line align, leading to a solid blocky appearance. Any [[Typographic alignment]] besides justified can lead to ragged text.
