# Obscurity causes system complexity
[[System Obscurity|Obscurity]] causes [[System Complexity]] because when important information is not obvious, you cannot judge the cost of making a change, or even how much of a system you need to change. Even after making a change that seems to work, you may have missed something important and introduced faults elsewhere. 

These are called [[Unknown unknowns]], and operating in that environment causes high [[Cognitive Load]].

[[Dependencies can be obscure]], which is when you don't know what [[System Dependencies]] you need to understand or update to modify the system. You might not even know they exist at all. [[Documentation removes obscurity]], but [[Obscurity is a design issue]] too.
