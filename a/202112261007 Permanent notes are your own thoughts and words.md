# Permanent notes are your own thoughts and words
[[202112251601 Permanent notes]] are written into *your* mental model. By not qouting or copying source material, you are forced to engage the writer in your head and [[202112261046 Writing is thinking]]. By using your own voice in a declarative way, you must also grapple with your belief in what you are putting into your knowledge base.

There's nothing wrong with referencing source material so you can keep track of where statements are sourced from, but they shouldn't be in the main body of the note if possible.
