# Complexity is anything that makes it hard to understand and change a system
[[The function of a complex system is hard to understand]], and when it needs to be modified [[It is hard to know where to change a complex system]]. Even when you start to make a change, [[It is hard to fix a complex system without introducing more faults]].

[[The complexity of a system is relative to a specific goal and time]], and to a particular person. [[There is no global measure of complexity]].
