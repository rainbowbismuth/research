# Make every step easy
*Make every step easy* is a tool for building workflows. If a step in your workflow isn't easy, ask yourself "what would make this task easy if I already had it?" and make a step to give yourself that product. If that new step isn't easy either, ask the question recursively or ask yourself if that is really what you need.

You can view [[The Workflow]] as a process to make every step of a writing project easy.
