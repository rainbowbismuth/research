# Why I don't like tags
In the past, whenever I've tried to use tags to organize anything, I very quickly resent it. It aligns with [[Don't fall into the Archivist mindset|why you shouldn't fall into the Archivist mindset]], but to go into more detail, tags feel kind of "messy", and that discourages me from writing in the first place, or even worse, encourage reorganizing.

Part of the issue is that the organization hasn't had an explicit goal in mind. You're putting down a mental model in your notes, without thinking about what the model is *for*.

Instead of tags, make sure [[Permanent notes are densely linked to form new connections]]. This will aid in rediscoverability.
