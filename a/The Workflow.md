# The Workflow
The Workflow is how you tackle thinking and gaining knowledge. By having a specific workflow, you can become more adapted to it, and recognize how each steps require seperate modes of thinking at different times. Ideally this leads to a [[Self-sustaining motivational cycle]], aided by the fact that [[Adaptation decreases energy costs]].

You start with a writing inbox, which is the collection of [[Fleeting notes]] you need to turn into (or add to existing) [[Permanent notes]]. Afterwards you should [[Discard fleeting notes promptly]] to remove them from your inbox.

Thinking is the only thing matters and [[Writing is thinking]]. With this perspective, [[Writing leads to engagement when not writing]]. Because [[Permanent notes leave room for open questions]] and more in depth thinking in general, you are more likely to know what questions to ask of experts when you have the chance, and see more answers when reading other material.

When developing your own piece of writing for a project, you will already have sources and arguments at hand, and your own words to work off of, leading to an easier first draft. This means the workflow is in line with the principle that you should [[Make every step easy]].

[[Rest is crucial]] for executing this workflow, but [[The Workflow is designed to be restful]] too.
