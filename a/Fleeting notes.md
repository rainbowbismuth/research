# Fleeting notes
Any kind of note that works as scratch space, or short term memory. You should [[Discard fleeting notes promptly]] after turning them into [[Permanent notes]]. They are often creating while working on a project or reading.

Inside of [[The Workflow]], I prefer to [[Take fleeting notes while reading on paper]].

While writing fleeting notes, I am:
- Making sure to [[Note the chapter or page]] so that the [[Permanent notes]] notes can be properly sourced. 
- [[Taking a bottom up viewpoint]], so that I'm not viewing the text in a project specific lens.
- Looking for contrasting or disconfirming facts so I can [[Take notes that lead to discussion]].
