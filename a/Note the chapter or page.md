# Note the chapter or page
When taking [[Fleeting notes]], it's useful to remember to reference not only the source but where it is located within it. This can save you work down the line if you write a piece that needs to pull a quote or source an argument.

The page or chapter doesn't need to be exact. This is primarily to save time for future you.
