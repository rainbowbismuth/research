#  Writing leads to engagement when not writing
Because [[Writing is thinking]], you will likely end up with more questions once you are done, or whole areas you don't understand. This leads you to make a note of what questions to ask experts when you have the chance, or discover missing pieces when reading other material.

This engagent is motivating, because you will see more progress faster, leading to a [[Self-sustaining motivational cycle]].
