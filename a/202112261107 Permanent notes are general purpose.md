# Permanent notes are general purpose
To make the best use of your time [[202112251601 Permanent notes]] are general purpose, not project specific. Projects are temporary and will not necessarily be completed. By writing notes in a general purpose way, you won't have to rewrite a new note about the same thing again for other situations.
