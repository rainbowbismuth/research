# Rest is crucial
Rest is crucial for any endeavour. This doesn't just mean getting enough high quality sleep, but it means taking true breaks during tasks as well.

Take naps, take breaks where you are genuinely not doing anything. [[Adaptation decreases energy costs]], so build processes that take less energy in the first place, but also build processes around rest itself.

[[Open threads continuously consume energy]], so to resting well is aided by taking [[Fleeting notes]] or practing other methodologies that put context down on paper where you won't forget or lose them.

Again, take naps. That doesn't require falling asleep either.
