# The Workflow is designed to be restful
[[The Workflow]] is designed to be restful because [[Rest is crucial]]. By putting context and thinking down on paper in [[Fleeting notes]] and [[Permanent notes]], it becomes easier to stop and take breaks without losing track.

Since [[Adaptation decreases energy costs]], having a standard general purpose process that is well worn allows you to capture those savings more often. [[Open threads continuously consume energy]] and having a process you can trust increases your ability to close those threads while resting.
