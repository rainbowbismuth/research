# Literate programming
A style of programming invented by [[Donald Knuth]] that involves writing a program and a document describing that program in an intertwined fashion, with the intent that reading the piece top to bottom explains the entire program.

Usually, a literate programming system involves two separate tools, one that converts your document into source code, and another that converts your document into a publishable format.

Computational notebooks, as used in data science, can be a smaller example of literate programming.

There are literate programming systems, including the original [[WEB]] created by Donald Knuth, or [[noweb]].
