# Permanent notes leave room for open questions

[[202112251601 Permanent notes]] leave room for open questions. By writing down open questions, you give yourself a chance to elaborate on details and arguments in the future. They are also opportunities for further research when you simply do not know the answer.

It can also be useful to think explicitly about what you don't know.
