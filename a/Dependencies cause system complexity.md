# Dependencies cause system complexity
[[System Dependencies]] cause [[System Complexity]] because each dependency is something you may have to understand and modify to change the system. 

Having to understand a dependency increases [[Cognitive Load]], which corresponds to the cost of making a change. Needing to not only understand but update multiple dependencies is the definition of [[Change Amplification]].
