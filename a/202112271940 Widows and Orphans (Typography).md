# Widows and Orphans (Typography)
In [[202112271925 Typography]], widows and orphans refer to lines that are alone in a paragraph, when the paragraph is broken into halves by a page break.

A **widow** is *alone at the top* of the page, meaning it is the last line of a paragraph that happens to be the first line of the new page.

A **orphan** is *alone at the bottom* of the page, meaning it is the first and only line of a new paragraph that continues on the next page.

You can remove widows and orphans from your page by inserting blank lines, or by any other [[202112271918 Microtypography]]-style adjustment to move a whole line to or from the page.
