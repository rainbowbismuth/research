# The Workflow
The Workflow is how you tackle thinking and gaining knowledge. By having a specific workflow, you can become more adapted to it, and recognize how each steps require seperate modes of thinking at different times. Ideally this leads to a [[202112261233 Self-sustaining motivational cycle]], aided by the fact that [[202112261237 Adaptation decreases energy costs]].

You start with a writing inbox, which is the collection of [[202112251559 Fleeting notes]] you need to turn into (or add to existing) [[202112251601 Permanent notes]]. Afterwards you should [[202112251602 Discard fleeting notes promptly]] to remove them from your inbox.

Thinking is the only thing matters and [[202112261046 Writing is thinking]]. With this perspective, [[202112261223 Writing leads to engagement when not writing]]. Because [[202112261102 Permanent notes leave room for open questions]] and more in depth thinking in general, you are more likely to know what questions to ask of experts when you have the chance, and see more answers when reading other material.

When developing your own piece of writing for a project, you will already have sources and arguments at hand, and your own words to work off of, leading to an easier first draft. This means the workflow is in line with the principle that you should [[202112261241 Make every step easy]].

[[202112261243 Rest is crucial]] for executing this workflow, but [[202112261244 The Workflow is designed to be restful]] too.
