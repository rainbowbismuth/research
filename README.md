# README
This is my personal collection of notes, organized into a few folders some of which may or may not be present depending upon the version of this repository you are looking at.

The intent is to have the same system of notes in different domains of my life, while keeping what needs to be seperate seperated.

## Viewing
These notes were created in Obsidian, though you could use any markdown viewer. All relative links are relative to this top level directory or the folder the note is in. I also make use of inline $\TeX$ formulas that many markdown viewers will not render for you.

## Sections
There are seven sections, each for `w`ork, `g`ithub, or `h`ome.

- **`a`** `wgh` &mdash; permant notes
- **`b`** `wgh` &mdash; reference & literature notes
- **`c`** `w..` &mdash; work notes
- **`d`** `..h` &mdash; journal
- **`e`** `w.h` &mdash; temporary project material
- **`f`** `w.h` &mdash; fleeting notes
- **`g`** `wgh` &mdash; meta, scripting

## Copyright
These notes are made available freely but not open-source nor public domain. I maintain copyright on *ALL* material I've written, with the exception that *within my place of work*, the material in folders **`c`**, **`e`** and **`f`** belong to my employer and are private and confidential.
