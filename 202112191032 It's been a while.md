# It's been a while

I haven't seriously journaled since February 2020, almost approaching two years now. A pandemic, move and a change of job have happened since. It feels like time to get back to it.

But my interests have moved beyond only journaling: I want to become a more thorough reader, and perform actual research. I want to take better notes at work too.

I'm not going to go on and on about any particular note system or philosophy but here's the idea:

* A public repository on GitHub for my reading & research notes.
* At work I will pull from that remote, and add my own work notes.
* At home I will do that same, except I'll be layering my journal on top.

That's it.
